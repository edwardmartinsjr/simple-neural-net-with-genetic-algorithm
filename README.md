1. This program is a single .py file.

2. This program is written in python 3.8, using only pythonâ€™s built-in libraries.

3. This program contains a main() method that tries to match a Pong game mechanics:
	
    a. Start a Pong game;
	
    b. Starting population;

    c. Iterate over the generations of the genetic algorithm:
	
    - Apply NN for each individual and scores the turn;
    - Exit loop if the maximum generation is reached.

4. Install requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Test:
```
python test_main.py -v
```

6. Run:
```
python main.py
```
